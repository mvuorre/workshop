## Plan

We plan to tackle some or all of the topics below:

1. [Collaboration and workflow](modules/workflow/index.qmd)
2. [Multilevel models](modules/models/index.qmd): Priors, outcome distributions, and model comparison
3. [Ordinal models](modules/ordinal/index.qmd)
4. [Signal Detection Theoretic models](modules/sdt/index.qmd)
5. [Censored models](modules/censored/index.qmd)

Our plan is to walk through (some of) them, and edit the code to address your questions. 

## Materials

The materials of this workshop are organized in [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) files. The source code is on [GitHub](https://github.com/mvuorre/workshop).

## Prerequisites

We assume some familiarity with basic statistical modeling and the R language. If you'd like a refresher, see [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/) & [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). To follow along, you need to have

- R (<https://cran.r-project.org/>)
- An R IDE like [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) (recommended for beginners) or [Positron](https://positron.posit.co/) (advanced)
- [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) (for rendering the materials into a website)
- [Git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git)
- A [GitHub account](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct) (if you want to participate in live troubleshooting / contributing)

### Build / reproduce

Note that building the project will run all the analysis documents, which involve bayesian models: This will take a long time. Because of this, you should first create an `.Renviron` file to describe your system settings (see `.Renviron.example`). For example,

```bash
echo "
MAX_CORES = 8
BRMS_BACKEND = "cmdstanr"
BRMS_THREADS = 2
BRMS_ITER = 1000
" >> .Renviron
```

Then, to recreate the materials locally, run the following in your terminal, *not* R. This will download the workshop materials (all source code), and then run the required code. 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mvuorre/workshop.git
cd brms-workshop.git
make # (requires GNU Make)
```

If you don't have make installed (i.e. you are on Windows), you need to first restore the R environment, prepare the data, and then render the project:

```bash
R -e 'renv::restore(prompt = FALSE)'
Rscript prepare-data.R
quarto render
```
